# Building from source

This guide builds the Snapshot operator and node-agent images from a checkout of
this repository and installs the chart against them. Most users should install
[from a release](../../README.md#from-a-release) instead — build from source when developing Snapshot or testing unreleased changes.

## Prerequisites

In addition to the [runtime prerequisites](../../README.md#prerequisites), the build needs:

- Go (matching the version pinned in the modules)
- Docker with Buildx
- A container registry the cluster can pull from, and push access to it
- `kubectl` and `helm` configured against the cluster

The node agent is **x86_64 (amd64) only** — `cuda-checkpoint` ships no other
architecture — so its image builds for `linux/amd64`.

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot.git
cd snapshot
```

## 2. Build the images

The root `Makefile` builds both images. Override `REGISTRY` and `VERSION` to tag
them for the registry:

```bash
make docker-build-agent docker-build-operator \
  REGISTRY=<registry> \
  VERSION=<tag>
```

This produces `<registry>/agent:<tag>` and
`<registry>/operator:<tag>`.

## 3. Push the images

Push both images to a registry the cluster can pull from:

```bash
docker push <registry>/agent:<tag>
docker push <registry>/operator:<tag>
```

## 4. Install the chart against the built images

Install the chart from the checkout, pointing the operator and agent images at
the built images:

```bash
helm install snapshot ./charts/snapshot \
  --namespace snapshot --create-namespace \
  --set image.operator.repository=<registry>/operator \
  --set image.operator.tag=<tag> \
  --set image.agent.repository=<registry>/agent \
  --set image.agent.tag=<tag>
```

See [Installation](../operations/install.md) for storage and uninstall options.

## Development workflow

Common `make` targets from the repo root:

- `make build` — compile the agent and operator
- `make test` — run unit tests across the `api`, `agent`, and `operator` modules
- `make lint` — run linters
- `make helm-lint` — lint the Helm chart
- `make check` — the full pre-merge gate (generate, license headers, fmt, tidy, lint, and more)
