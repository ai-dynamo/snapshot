# Storage

Snapshot keeps every checkpoint in a single shared volume that all node agents
mount. Each agent reads and writes checkpoint artifacts there; workload pods never
mount checkpoint storage.

## The checkpoint volume

Today the checkpoint store is a Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). Because
agents on multiple GPU nodes mount it concurrently, it must support
`ReadWriteMany` (RWX). The chart provisions one PVC per cluster by default and
mounts it at `/checkpoints` in every agent.

## Configuration

The chart's `storage.pvc` values control the PVC:

| Value | Purpose | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `storage.pvc.create` | Create the PVC (set `false` to use an existing one) | `true` |
| `storage.pvc.name` | Shared RWX PVC mounted by every agent | `snapshot-pvc` |
| `storage.pvc.size` | Requested size | `1Ti` |
| `storage.pvc.storageClass` | Storage class (empty = cluster default) | `""` |
| `storage.pvc.basePath` | Mount path inside the agent | `/checkpoints` |

If the cluster has no default storage class that can provision RWX, set one:

```bash
helm install snapshot oci://ghcr.io/ai-dynamo/snapshot/snapshot \
  --namespace snapshot --create-namespace \
  --set storage.pvc.storageClass=<rwx-storage-class>
```

### Use an existing PVC

Point the chart at an existing RWX claim instead of creating one:

```bash
helm install snapshot ... \
  --set storage.pvc.create=false \
  --set storage.pvc.name=<existing-rwx-pvc>
```

The named claim must support `ReadWriteMany`. Access modes are immutable, so a
`ReadWriteOnce` claim cannot be converted in place — create a new RWX claim and, if
the existing checkpoints are needed, copy them over once.

## Retention

Chart-created PVCs are retained when the Helm release is removed, so checkpoints
survive an uninstall.

## Other backends

`storage.type` currently supports `pvc`. Object-storage backends (`s3`, `oci`) are
reserved in the chart for future use and are not supported today.

### PageBroker restore source

When PageBroker is enabled, `pageBroker.restoreMode` selects the restore source
for pods that do not set `nvidia.com/snapshot-pagebroker: "false"`:

- `direct` (default) prepares a PageBroker transaction and mounts the original
  checkpoint directory read-only for CRIU. It does not copy CPU images into staging.
- `staged` copies checkpoint files into PageBroker staging before CRIU runs.

### CRIU images on NFS

Before restoring from NFS, the agent prefetches regular non-page CRIU `.img`
files with up to 32 readers and 1 MiB read buffers. This overlaps small metadata
reads and fetches ghost-file contents before CRIU copies them serially. Ghost
images contain files that were unlinked while the checkpointed process still
referenced them, such as NCCL shared-memory files under `/dev/shm`.

Prefetch skips `pages-*.img`, which contain CPU memory payloads, and does not read
GPU payloads. Local filesystems are unchanged. Prefetch failures leave CRIU to
read and validate the images normally. The agent includes prefetch time in
`criu_prepare` and in the total restore duration.

Each restore uses at most 32 MiB of read buffers plus ordinary reclaimable file cache.
The cache is shared for the same filesystem files and can remain after restore
until reclaimed. No private copy is retained, and no node, mount, or backing-device
read-ahead setting is changed. Size the agent's restore memory budget for
its non-page images as well as its other restore resources.

### Diagnose slow GPU restores

The agent's `Restore timing summary` separates CPU restore (`criu_restore`), GPU
restore (`cuda_restore`), and staging. Measure application readiness and a fresh
inference request separately. Framework compilation and autotuning after restore
will show up in application readiness, not in the completed CUDA restore phase.

For a large CustomStorage artifact, compare its GPU payload size with the sustained
read bandwidth available to the restoring node. For example, 520 GB takes at least
21 seconds to read at 25 GB/s, before CPU restore and any GPU setup that does not
overlap the transfer. Increasing pinned-memory resources alone cannot remove a
storage bandwidth limit. Tune `pageBroker.transferBufferCount` and
`pageBroker.transferChunkBytes` together, and account for their product on every
visible GPU.

When comparing runs, keep the model revision, workload image, GPU count, checkpoint
preparation, and storage mount options fixed. Check the mount options actually in
use on the destination node. A different NFS client may not support the same
connection and multipath options. Preserve compatible model, compiler, and
autotuning caches when a new capture is necessary.

PageBroker emits NVTX ranges for CUDA setup, payload transfer, storage waits, and
completion. An NVTX-only trace can distinguish slow native CUDA preparation from
slow storage. CUDA API tracing can interfere with native checkpoint operations,
so do not use it for the performance control. Confirm results with repeated
unprofiled restores and fresh inference.

When testing a build, set `image.agent.tag` for both the agent and PageBroker, and
verify the running containers' image digests. A separate `image.pageBroker.tag` is
rejected because the two images share an internal protocol and ship as a pair.
